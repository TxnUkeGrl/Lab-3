C#.NET LAB 3: DECISION MAKING

NOTE: Points will be awarded for items that are written correctly in themselves but don’t actually work because other things are broken. There is a total of 10 points available for this lab.

Task: Use conditional statements to automate the decision-making process.

What will the application do?

● 1 Point: The application prompts to the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100.

● The application displays the associated result based on the integer range entered.

Build Specifications:

● 1 Point: Use if/else statements to make different actions depending on user input.

● Given an integer entered by a user, perform the following conditional actions:

    ○ 1 Point: If the integer is odd, print the number entered and “Odd.”

    ○ 1 Point: If the integer entered is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 25, print “Even and less than 25.”

    ○ 1 Point: If the integer entered is even and in the inclusive range of 26 to 60, print “Even.”

    ○ 1 Point: If the integer entered is even and greater than 60, print the number entered and “Even”.

    ○ 1 Point: If the integer entered is odd and greater than 60, print the number entered and “Odd.”

Additional Requirements:

● 1 Point: For answering Lab Summary when submitting to the LMS

● -2 Points: if there are any syntax errors or if the program does not run (for example, in a Main method).

Extended Exercises (2 points maximum):

● 1 Point: Include a set of parameters so that the program ends officially.

● 1 Point: Ask for user information (ex. name) at the beginning of the application, and use it to refer to the user throughout the application.

● 1 Point: Add validation to guarantee that a user enters a positive integer between 1 and 100.

Console Preview:

Enter a number between 1 and 100: {user input here, for example: 3}

Output: {output here, for example: 3 and odd}

Continue? (y/n) {user input here, for example: Y}

Enter a number between 1 and 100: {user input here, for example: 24}

Output: {output here, for example: Even and less than 25}

Continue? (y/n) {user input here, for example: Y}

Enter a number between 1 and 100: {user input here, for example: 75}

Output: {output here, for example: 75 and odd}

Continue? (y/n) {user input here, for example: N}

Bye!
